#-title Escapes
## To have a line start with a # double it at the 
## beginning, the first will be ignored
directives are stripped at both ends, but if quotes are used this can beginning
mitigated, if they only appear at one end they are parsed as normal
#-warning      space around me is stripped     
#-warning "       not around me     "
#-warning "   as the qoute is only on one end it will be included
#-warning          other end"
#-warning ""if actual quotes are desired they can simply be doubled""
